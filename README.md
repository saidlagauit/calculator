# Simple Calculator Project

This is a simple calculator project built using Ruby, JavaScript, and CSS. The calculator allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

## Example Code

Here's an example of how the calculator logic can be implemented in Ruby:

```ruby
def add(num1, num2)
  num1 + num2
end

def subtract(num1, num2)
  num1 - num2
end

def multiply(num1, num2)
  num1 * num2
end

def divide(num1, num2)
  num1 / num2
end

# Example usage
result = add(5, 3)
puts result
```

This is just a basic structure and implementation of the calculator project. Feel free to customize and enhance it according to your specific requirements and desired functionality.
